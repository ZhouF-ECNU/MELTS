# MELTS

In this work,  we propose a novel approach called
MELTS (Multi-viEw LatenT space learning with Similarity preservation). The method leverages both (1) the similarity information of different view pairs and (2) the label information of distinct sample pairs, to learn a latent representation among multiple views.
